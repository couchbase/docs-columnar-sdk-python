:description: Logging with the Columnar Python SDK.


[abstract]
{description}

The Columnar Python SDK allows logging via the standard `logging` module, or directly to the console.


== Enabling Logging

// 
.Python Logging Module
[source,python]
----
include::devguide:example$python/logging_example.py[tag=logging]
----

== Logging via Environmental Settings

IMPORTANT: Only one logger can be created.  Either use `PYCBCC_LOG_LEVEL` to create a console logger or python `logging`, as mentioned above.

In the command line environment, the PYCBCC_LOG_LEVEL variable is set as follows:

.GNU/Linux and Mac
[source,console]
----
export PYCBCC_LOG_LEVEL=<log-level>
----

.Windows
[source,console]
----
set PYCBCC_LOG_LEVEL=<log-level>
----

Where `<log-level>` is either `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` or `trace`.


== Log Levels

You can increase the log level for greater verbosity (more information) in the logs:

* off -- disables all logging, which is normally set by default.
* critical -- important functionality not working.
* error -- error messages.
* warn -- error notifications.
* info -- useful notices, not often.
* debug -- diagnostic information, minimum level required to investigate problems.
* trace -- detailed diagnostic information, often required to investigate problems.

== Log Redaction

Redacting logs is a two-stage process.
If you want to redact client logs (for example before handing them off to the Couchbase Support team) you first need to enable log redaction in your application.
This is done through the https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-python-client/couchbase_api/options.html#clusteroptions[`ClusterOptions`], setting `log_redaction` to `True`.

Once the SDK writes the logs with the tags to a file, you can then use the
xref:{version-server}@server:cli:cbcli/cblogredaction.adoc[`cblogredaction` tool] to obfuscate the log.
